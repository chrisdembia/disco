A physics engine to play around with. I'm creating it for completely selfish
purposes. The first is to make use of some fun things I've learned. The second
is to have a familiar platform in which I can implement things I learn or want
to learn in the future.

Things I've learned
-------------------
- David Cheriton taught me how to create complete and consistent interfaces in
  C++. I hope to apply his discipline to this code.
- Paul Mitiguy taught me how to be very precise with the quantities I use.

Things I hope to learn
----------------------
- How to write a physics engine.
